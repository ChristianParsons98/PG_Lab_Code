# PG_Lab_Code

This repository contains utility notebooks developed for the PG research group to assist with laboratory operations, particularly in chemical preparation and stoichiometric calculations.

## 🧪 Description

The notebooks in this repository are designed to streamline common laboratory calculations, such as determining the required mass of chemical compounds for solution preparation and performing stoichiometric conversions. These tools aim to reduce manual errors and improve efficiency in lab workflows.

## 🔧 Techniques Used

- **User Input Handling:** Interactive prompts for user-defined chemical formulas and desired solution parameters.
- **Stoichiometric Calculations:** Automated computations based on chemical formulas to determine molar masses and required quantities.
- **Data Visualization:** Displaying calculation results in a clear and concise manner within Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📦 Libraries and Tools

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/): Interactive computing environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code and equations.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/): Python library for symbolic mathematics, used here for parsing chemical formulas and performing calculations.
